Refactoring documentation
=========================

[NOTE]
====
This is the log of me, trying to fit change the way of documenting for the
Machinekit project. With this I'm testing the workflow for enhancing the documentation.
====

I made 3 git repositories on github/luminize

. `upstream`
. `enhancement`
. `subtree`


Locally I made 3 directories files in a git repo and added /docs/src directory to `upstream`

[NOTE]
====
`upstream` means "LunixCNC"

`enhancement` means "Machinekit"

`subtree` means "/docs"
====

further the situation I made is:

. `upstream` has the remote `upstream`
. `enhancement` has the remotes `upstream-source` and `enhancement`
. `enhancement` has the branches
** `upstream-branch` and is tracking `upstream-source/master`
** `master` and is tracking `enhancement/master`
** `subtree-branch` (in which this log is held). and is tracking `enhancement/subtree-branch`

switch to a branch with `git branch checkout <branch name>.` and then
type `git branch -u <remote name>/<branch name>`

if you want to see which branch is tracking what type `git branch -vv` it then will
give output like something like this in the `enhancement` repo:

```
  master          c216105 [enhancement/master] add /docs and /docs/src with textfiles§
* subtree-branch  9c1645c [enhancement/subtree-branch] log: add more info about remote branches and tracking
  upstream-branch 8216473 [upstream-source/master: ahead 2] log: add more steps and info
```

== update done in `upstream`
when some change is done in `upstream` then the following must happen:

. `upstream/master` (a.k.a. upstream-source/master) pulled into `enhancement/upstream-branch`
. `enhancement/master` is the branch to which updates and new stuff that is usable
are are being applied from `enhancement/upstream-branch`
. then

== testing the workflow

. change a file in local `upstream`
. push to `upstream`
. in local `enhancement/upstream-branch` pull `upstream-source/master`
. in local `enhancement/master` rebase onto `enhancement/upstream-branch`
. then add a little correction into the new file
. commit
. in local `enhancement/subtree-branch` rebase unto `enhancement/master`
. push both `subtree-branch` and `master` to github.

== testing renaming to `.asciidot`
here I'll test how the renaming of .txt in `enhancement/subtree-branch` will work
with changes from upstream. So the same as the next test, but at the same time a
file is changed in `upstream` i'll rename a docyment in `/docs/src` from the
`enhancement/subtree-branch`.

== split operation
see link:terminal%20output%20of%20split%20operation.asciidoc[this file] for the
output of the split operation. Needs to be touched up

== pushing to `subtree/master` after commit in `enhancement/subtree-branch`
now there comes a time when changes need to be pushed to the `subtree` repo.

I made a commit in `enhancement/subtree-branch` in the /docs directory. for pushing to the `subtree` remote
you need to do `git subtree push --prefix=<directory> <remote> <branch of remote>
```
Bass-MacBook-Pro-3:enhancement basdebruijn$ git subtree push --prefix=docs subtree master
git push using:  subtree master
-n 1/       5 (0)
-n 2/       5 (0)
-n 3/       5 (0)
-n 4/       5 (1)
-n 5/       5 (2)

   bfbee0d..d2c9f57  d2c9f57c23845c99970dcb626fb8f5dd9af27987 -> master
```

the next point will be me pulling the changes I do to this file on-line in `subtree` repo.

== pulling from `subtree/master` in `enhancement/subtree-branch`
you need to do `git subtree pull --prefix=<directory> <remote> <branch of remote>
see output:
```
Bass-MacBook-Pro-3:enhancement basdebruijn$ git subtree pull --prefix=docs subtree master
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.

Pull is not possible because you have unmerged files.
Please, fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'
as appropriate to mark resolution, or use 'git commit -a'.

[subtree-branch 25b478a] Merge commit '27c91beaaa5e53d7be9b1eca3c8b672d9b14001e' into subtree-branch
```
I'll try once again to change in the github environment in `subtree`, commit and pull back locally in `enhancement/subtree0branch`
I keep getting merge conflicts when pulling `subtree` into `enhancement/subtree-branch`. I'll try again, but then in the `subtree` which was `split` when adding the original stuff back into the `enhancement` repo.
I need to pull when I'm into the `enhancement/subtree` branch which was created at the time of the originial adding of the subtree to the repo
== easy adding to the documentation
If I am correct then the "/docs" should go als in subtree.wiki.git as that will
be easily modified by other people. I will test this later.

Then modifications from Github can be pulled into subtree
